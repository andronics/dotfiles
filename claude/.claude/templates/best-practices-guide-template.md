## Lessons from Experience

### [Specific Case/Example 1]
- **Status**: [Outcome or classification]
- **Learning**: [Key insight gained]
- **Pattern**: [Generalizable pattern identified]

## Decision Process

1. **[Step 1]** - [Specific action with criteria]
2. **[Step 2]** - [Specific action with criteria]
3. **[Step 3]** - [Specific action with criteria]
4. **[Step 4]** - [Specific action with criteria]
5. **[Step 5]** - [Specific action with criteria]

## Common Error Patterns

### [Error Category 1]
- **Pattern**: "[Common phrase or assumption]" → [What this actually leads to]
- **Reality**: [What usually happens instead]
- **Better Approach**: [Recommended alternative]

### [Error Category 2]
- **Pattern**: "[Another common assumption]" → [Problematic outcome]
- **Reality**: [Actual complexity or challenge]
- **Better Approach**: [Recommended alternative]

### [Error Category 3]
- **Pattern**: "[Third common mistake]" → [Why this is problematic]
- **Reality**: [What gets overlooked]
- **Better Approach**: [Recommended alternative]

## Calibration Techniques

Before [making decision/proceeding], ask:
- [Key question 1 with reasoning]
- [Key question 2 with reasoning]
- [Key question 3 with reasoning]
